# About
This repository contains the jupyter notebooks for sleep data, as well as the virtual machine set up via Docker.

Copy the files into the directory containing the data. Launch a virtual machine instance by typing `docker-compose up -d --build` in the command line. The jupyter lab can then be accessed by typing `jupyter lab` in the command line.
To terminate the virtual machine instance, quit the jupyter lab and then type `docker-compose down` in the command line.
